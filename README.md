## What I Built vs AI Assistance
AI was most helpful in suggesting formulas and logic for metrics like **Driving Score**, **Walking Score**, and the **Urban Index**.  
For **styling**, I had to take the lead: guiding AI toward my preferred design choices, and in some cases building it myself. Along the way, AI occasionally broke the styling system, which I debugged and fixed manually.  
I also structured the project folders myself, based on my own preferences.

## Approach
This was my first time working with **OpenStreetMap** and the **Overpass API**.  
- I started by reading the documentation and asking clarifying questions to ChatGPT.  
- Once I understood the APIs, I queried them, stored the responses in `useState`, and used the data on the results page.

## Assumptions & Design Decisions
- I aimed for a **modern look** with **bright colors**.  
- The **results page** displays information in **cards**, designed to feel like a clean, dashboard-style layout.
